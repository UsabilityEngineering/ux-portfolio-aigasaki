The Apple TV and more importantly, the first generation remote is one of the worst streaming devices I’ve ever had the displeasure of using. I went over to my grandparents’ house to download Discovery Plus on their device so that they could watch their favorite survival and cooking shows, but looking at the remote confused me. The physical design of the remote and box may seem appealing at first glance for its simplicity, but every other aspect of the design is difficult to use and navigate. 

In terms of the remote, there is no clear D-pad, which is the series of buttons placed in a cross design to navigate up, down, left, or right, or even a designated “OK” button that users can press to confirm their choices. Instead, the remote relies on the user’s knowledge of using natural gestures, swiping right to go right, swiping left for left, and so on, similar to a trackpad on a laptop. Understandably, there is most likely a tutorial when using the Apple TV for the first time for how to use the remote, but as someone who used it for the first time at someone else’s house, using the remote was not **learnable**. Learnability is the ease in which a product can be picked up and understood by users the first time they encounter the interface. Both my grandparents and I struggled to use the remote and understand the Apple TV interface.

The scroll/navigation is also dependent on how hard you swipe as well as how long you leave your finger on the edges; I find it far too sensitive, especially when I think of my grandparents trying to use this system. Trying to navigate to a specific app or option on the screen can be difficult in that sometimes you might scroll too far or too fast and have to correct it.

Additionally, this remote does not have a “back” button or a “home” button that many other streaming device remotes may have. Instead, there is a button that says “menu” and a button with a symbol that represents a screen or a TV. I initially thought the TV button took me back to the home screen. However, it takes me to the Apple TV app instead, and for a long time, I confused this screen as the home screen.

When the TV button is clicked, it displays the screen shown above. At first, I was skeptical that this was the home screen because of how the cluttered the layout seemed, with shows everywhere and autoplaying in the background. But I was convinced that it was in fact the home screen because of the tabs at the top, “Watch Now”, “Apple TV+”, “Store”, “Sports”, “Library”, and a magnifying glass. As mentioned before, I wanted to download the Discovery Plus app for my grandparents, so assumedly, my first reaction was to navigate to the store tab. That was a mistake because it only takes me to the Apple TV store page, where you can rent or buy movies. I tried using the search feature thinking that I might have to search for the channel, but that only pulls up shows or movies.

Thus, I tried clicking the “Menu” button, seeing as this the only other button that would make sense in this situation, which takes me to this screen. I learned that the menu button is considered the back button on the Apple TV remote, which goes against several conventions of other remotes. 

The layout of this screen resembles a lot like the app system on iOS devices, where it is organized with the more important apps highlighted in a grey box and the other apps below it. Now, I’m beginning to understand how the operating system works due to owning an iPhone and the apps and layout seem familiar to me. Having to figure out just where the home page was located was completely unsatisfying. It went against knowledge I originally had about other streaming devices and did not carry out the same conventions in terms of design of the screens as well as the remote. The Apple TV relies heavily on your knowledge of owning an iPhone and being familiar with the default apps. In order from left to right, the apps currently displayed on the screen are the Apple TV app, music app, games app, fitness app, and the photos app. The first three are effective in that the symbol clearly displays its meaning. But the fitness and photos app are relying on the knowledge of being an Apple product owner, and are not as effective towards first time Apple device owners.
