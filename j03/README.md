# GE Stacked Washer Dryer Combo
### By Allison Lee, 05/17/2022

In fall of 2020, not even 3 months of living in my new apartment, the washer dryer unit broke and flooded the apartment. And as terrible as this sounds with the inconvenience of having to take out the wet, soapy laundry from the wash and find a laundromat that was open at 8pm, I could not be more thrilled. A broken machine meant it was going to be replaced with a much newer and reliable model. 

The new washer dryer unit exceeded my expectations, and strangely, I no longer dreaded the idea of doing laundry. For me, older washing machines felt complicated and the array of numbers, settings, and dials overwhelmed me. Their **learnability** (the ease in which a product can be picked up and understood by users the first time they encounter the interface) was difficult to master, to the point where I stuck with the one setting I was familiar with.

But the new GE Stacked Washer Dryer Combo that replaced the old washing machine was quick to learn. The dials are placed in order from left to right of the typical laundry cycle, wash then dry. This follows a **natural mapping**, in which the order of controls matches that to the outcome in the real world. Starting with the washer cycles dial, it is made clear to the user that there are four quandrants: colors, whites, extraneous items, and other functions. The dial has a sloped section with a line down the center to be an indicator of which function the user is going to select. The dial will click and snap into place, lining up with the white circle for the function to let the user know which function they have selected. This is considered **feedback**, which communicates the results of any interaction. The other two dials indicate temperature and load size, and these dials also provide the same feedback as to which function the user is selecting. The ease in which the user is able to learn this washing system also factors in with the efficiency of the washing machine, in that users do not have to spend much time thinking about which actions they need to take. If they know that they plan to wash a medium load of colored clothes
