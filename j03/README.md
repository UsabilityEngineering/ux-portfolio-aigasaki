# GE Stacked Washer Dryer Combo
### By Allison Lee, 05/17/2022

In fall of 2020, not even 3 months of living in my new apartment, the washer dryer unit broke and flooded the apartment. And as terrible as this sounds with the inconvenience of having to take out the wet, soapy laundry from the wash and find a laundromat that was open at 8pm, I could not be more thrilled. A broken machine meant it was going to be replaced with a much newer and reliable model. 

The new washer dryer unit exceeded my expectations.
