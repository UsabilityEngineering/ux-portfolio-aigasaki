The Oster Toaster Oven is one of the best kitchen appliances I have owned. Despite the large counter space it takes up, this toaster oven is reliable and perfect for all sorts of recipes. 

The toaster oven has 3 knobs total to control the temperature, the type of bake function, and a timer for how long the oven will stay on. There are symbols next the knobs to indicate its function: the theromometer with Farenheit indicating temperature, the oven symbol with function written underneath it, and the time with a clock symbol. Though the timer does not have an indicator of which units of time, a user can quickly assume that it would be minutes because the timer goes up to 60 and hours would not make sense, nor would seconds. 

Because of the lack of complexity, a user could pick up on how to use the toaster oven quickly; thus it has strong **learnablility**. For **safety** purposes, the red LED light at the bottom will light up when the toaster oven is on, and will turn off when the oven is off.
