The Oster Toaster Oven is one of the best kitchen appliances I have owned. Despite the large counter space it takes up, this toaster oven is reliable and perfect for all sorts of recipes. 

The toaster oven has 3 knobs total to control the temperature, the type of bake function, and a timer for how long the oven will stay on. There are symbols next the knobs to indicate its function: the theromometer with Farenheit indicating temperature, the oven symbol with function written underneath it, and the time with a clock symbol. Because of the lack of complexity, a user could pick up on how to use the toaster oven quickly; thus it has strong **learnablility**.
